                <p>Comes in the first year of study I don't know any friends in the department. And this is the year that I have to study online due to the covid 19 virus. When I came to study in my first year of university. I had to study in TU subjects. I made quite a few friends. And in the beginning, finding information about studying in the faculty was quite difficult. Because I read the faculty documents and didn't quite understand which subjects I had to choose. Until the end ,I've got advice from seniors. So I survived XD. After studying some subjects , I met new friends from various faculties. And the first friend I became close with in the faculty was inkrak.</p>
